# Contributing

One smell per file. Small, self-contained, and written from scratch.

## Before you start

**Never paste code from a real codebase.** Every snippet here is a *reconstruction*: a minimal example written
from scratch to illustrate a smell. This is not a formality. Pasting from work republishes someone else's
unlicensed code, and a recognisable snippet publishes a colleague's work as an example of what not to do. The
snippet ceiling exists partly to make this easy — no real code is that small, so rebuilding is the only way to
hit it, in `architecture/` as much as in `code/`.

Check whether the smell is already here. Search `catalog.json` for the mechanism before writing a new file —
`make new-smell` also names any existing smells whose id shares a word with your slug, which catches the
obvious collisions but not a duplicate filed under different words.

## Adding a smell

1. Run `make new-smell`. It asks for the slug and the filing, then writes
   `snippets/<language>/<group>/<slug>.md` from `TEMPLATE.md` (`ARGS="--language rust"` for Rust, which
   converts the template's version field and code fences for you). Answer `architecture` for the group only if the
   smell is one of the few that cannot be shown in 15 lines (see **Groups**).
2. Name the slug after the smell, not the fix: `mutable-default-argument`, not `use-none-default`. The
   scaffolder refuses a slug that is already an id or an alias, and lists existing smells sharing a word with
   yours — read those before writing, since a near-duplicate is worth less than an alias on the entry that
   already exists.
3. Finish the frontmatter. The scaffolder fills in the filing and leaves `signature`, `distinguish` and
   `keywords`, which are the three fields that need thought. Every field except `aliases` and `source` is
   required.
4. Write the three body sections: `## Smell`, `## Why it's bad`, `## Better`.
5. Regenerate the catalog: `make catalog`.
6. Commit both your snippet and the updated `catalog.json`.

Scaffolding by hand is fine too — `cp TEMPLATE.md snippets/python/code/<slug>.md` and fill it in. The
scaffolder is a convenience over the closed lists, not a required step; `uv run new_smell.py --help` covers the
flags that skip the prompts, which is what you want when adding several at once.

## Groups

The corpus is split one level deeper than the language: `snippets/<language>/code/` and
`snippets/<language>/architecture/`. The directory is not a second taxonomy — it selects the snippet size ceiling,
and nothing else. There is no `group` field; the path carries it.

**`code/` — 15 lines.** Almost everything. The smell is visible in one function, and the ceiling is what keeps
it visible.

**`architecture/` — 40 lines.** The smell is *the relationship between* several pieces of code: a subsystem
assembled by its callers, a dependency pointing the wrong way, a layer that exists but is bypassed. Two call
sites are the evidence, so one function cannot be the snippet.

Reach for `architecture/` only when a reader could not identify the smell from a 15-line version, not when 15
lines would merely be tight. A long snippet in `code/` is a snippet that needs cutting; a shortened snippet in
`architecture/` is a smell nobody can see. Everything else in this document applies unchanged to both — same
frontmatter, same three sections, same `distinguish`, same reconstruction rule.

## The fields that need thought

Most of the frontmatter is filing. Three fields are the actual work.

**`signature`** — one sentence naming the *mechanism*. This is what an LLM reads when deciding whether your
smell is worth investigating, so write it to be matched, not to be read aloud. "A function default is a list or
dict, so one object is shared across every call" is a signature. "Causes confusing bugs" is not.

**`distinguish`** — one sentence describing the *near miss*: code that looks like your smell but is fine. This
is the most valuable field in the corpus, because the main failure mode of the whole system is flagging correct
code that merely resembles a smell. If you cannot write the near miss, you do not yet understand your smell
well enough to add it.

**`keywords`** — literal tokens and phrases that appear in or near the offending code: `"=[]"`, `"except:"`,
`"time.sleep"`. Lexical hooks, not concepts. A keyword that never appears in real code is useless. Concepts go
in `tags`.

## Severity

Be honest about what the smell costs. The corpus is useless if a naming preference is filed with the same weight
as a SQL injection.

- `bug` — wrong today; produces incorrect behaviour as written
- `trap` — works today, bites later; correct until a condition changes
- `taste` — works and keeps working, but reads badly

`taste` is welcome and is most of the point of this project. It carries one extra obligation: `## Better` has to
be good, because "I dislike this" is unactionable without "write this instead".

## Rules the validator enforces

Run `make check` before opening a pull request: it validates the corpus and runs the server test suite. CI runs
the same two things, and everything hard-blocks. `make help` lists the rest of the targets.

- The `## Smell` block is 15 lines or fewer in `code/`, 40 or fewer in `architecture/`
- The file sits in a known group directory: `code/` or `architecture/`
- Both code blocks parse under `ast.parse` — they need not run, and `...` is fine
- `category` and `topic` are values listed in `TAXONOMY.md`
- `signature` and `distinguish` are each a single sentence ending in a period
- The filename matches `[a-z0-9-]+`, and no alias collides with any other slug or alias
- The three H2 sections are present, in order
- `catalog.json` matches what regeneration would produce

Adding a `category` or `topic` value means editing `TAXONOMY.md` in the same pull request, and that is a
deliberate change — check that nothing existing fits first.

## Out of scope for now

Smells that need more than 40 lines even as an architecture entry. Past that size the thing being described is
a system rather than a smell, and it does not fit this schema.

## Attribution

`source` is optional credit for whoever contributed the smell. It is not a provenance field for the code —
there is no provenance, because the snippet is a reconstruction.
