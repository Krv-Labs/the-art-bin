# The art bin

The place to share your special snowflakes, pet peeves and other works of art. 
All so your LLM can learn what not to do and for you to have a good laugh.

```python
this_is_true = False

if not this_is_true:
    print("You are such a special snowflake!")
```

## What this is

A corpus of bad Python, Rust and TypeScript code, one **smell** per file, structured so a machine can find the ones your codebase
resembles. An MCP server serves the corpus to an LLM reviewing real code, so instead of generic advice you get
"line 42 is `mutable-default-argument`, here is why, here is what to write instead."

Linters already own the mechanically detectable defects — `ruff` and Semgrep will find bare excepts forever.
What no linter ships is *taste*: the house style, the pet peeves, the patterns that run fine and that your team
still refuses to accept. That knowledge normally lives in reviewers' heads and leaks out one PR comment at a
time. This makes it addressable.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `snippets/<language>/code/` | The corpus, for `python`, `rust` and `typescript` (which covers plain JavaScript too). One smell per file, 15 lines or fewer. |
| `snippets/<language>/architecture/` | Smells that live between components, where 15 lines cannot show the problem. One entry per Gang of Four pattern, describing the code the pattern answers. |
| `catalog.json` | Generated summary of every smell, small enough to read whole. |
| `TAXONOMY.md` | The closed lists a smell is filed against. |
| `TEMPLATE.md` | Skeleton for a new smell. |
| `validate.py` | Schema and constraint checks. Runs in CI. |
| `new_smell.py` | Scaffolds a smell file from the template, with the closed lists as menus. |
| `install.sh` | Registers the server with an MCP client. |
| `src/art_bin_server/` | The MCP server. |
| `tests/` | Tests for the server, run against the real corpus. |
| `CONTEXT.md` | The project glossary. |
| `docs/` | Design documents and architecture decision records. |

## Installing

Clone it and run the installer. There is nothing to build — the server launches with `uv run`, which resolves
its own dependencies the first time a client starts it. You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and nothing
else.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ErnstRoell/the-art-bin
cd the-art-bin
./install.sh                            # Claude Code, user scope
./install.sh --client desktop           # Claude Desktop, this platform's config
./install.sh --config ~/.cursor/mcp.json  # anything else that speaks mcpServers
```

Install it as a tool, which puts `art-bin-server` on your PATH:

```sh
uv tool install .            # from a clone
uv tool install git+https://github.com/ErnstRoell/the-art-bin
```

The wheel bundles the corpus, so the installed server needs no checkout to read from:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-art-bin": {
      "command": "art-bin-server"
    }
  }
}
```

An install is a snapshot of the corpus as of that build — `uv tool upgrade art-bin-server` to pick up new
smells. To serve the corpus live from a clone instead, which is what you want while adding smells, register it
against the checkout:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-art-bin": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/path/to/the-art-bin", "run", "art-bin-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

`./install.sh --help` lists the rest, and `make install-mcp ARGS='...'` is the same thing from the Makefile.

## Using it

Ask your client to review some code. The server exposes three read-only tools and no analysis — nothing here
accepts source code, scores anything, or decides what matches. The corpus goes to the model; the model does the
judging ([ADR 001](./docs/adr/001-corpus-as-queryable-knowledge-base.md)).

| Tool | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `list_smells` | The whole catalog: id, signature, severity, category, topic, tags, keywords. Optional filters for severity, category, topic, language, `python_version`, `rust_version` and `typescript_version`. |
| `get_smells` | Full records for specific ids: snippet, why it's bad, corrected version, `distinguish`, and `sources` (each claim linked to the passage that states it). Aliases resolve; unknown ids come back in `unknown`. |
| `get_taxonomy` | The closed lists with corpus counts, for building valid filters. |

Callers are expected to work in two phases — one `list_smells` to shortlist, one `get_smells` to confirm. The
server's `instructions` field states that contract, and the full surface is specified in
[MCP API Overview](./docs/003-mcp-api-overview.md).

The server finds the corpus in three steps, first match wins: `ART_BIN_ROOT`, then the first directory above
its own location holding both `catalog.json` and `snippets/`, then the copy bundled into the wheel. A clone
therefore beats the bundle, so a contributor always reads their own edits. Set `ART_BIN_ROOT` to override both
— which is what a deployment that separates the server from the corpus would do.

## Developing the server

```sh
uv sync
uv run pytest -q          # 41 tests, including 7 over a real stdio subprocess
uv run art-bin-server     # start on stdio
```

`make help` lists the targets, including `make install-tool` to put the binary on PATH and `make build` for
the wheel. `make catalog` before either, if you have added smells — the wheel bundles the catalog as it
stands at build time.

`src/art_bin_server/corpus.py` is the reading layer — catalog, record parsing, alias resolution, filters — and
`src/art_bin_server/server.py` is the tool surface. Frontmatter parsing is deliberately duplicated between
`corpus.py` and `validate.py`, so that contributors can validate a snippet without installing the server. The
schema they agree on is [Snippet Design](./docs/002-snippet-design.md).

## Adding a smell

```sh
make new-smell                          # asks for the slug and the filing
make new-smell SLUG=my-new-smell        # asks only for the filing
# write it
make catalog                            # regenerate catalog.json
make check                              # what CI runs
```

The scaffolder fills in the frontmatter you would otherwise get wrong: it offers only the `category` and `topic`
values `TAXONOMY.md` actually lists, refuses a slug that collides with an existing id or alias, and points out
existing smells sharing a word with yours so near-duplicates surface before you write one. What it deliberately
leaves at their template placeholders are `signature`, `distinguish` and `keywords` — the three fields that are
the actual work. Answer `architecture` at the group prompt for a smell that needs 40 lines, and see
`uv run new_smell.py --help` for the flags that skip the prompts entirely (`make new-smell` forwards them as
`ARGS='...'`).

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) first — particularly the part about never pasting code from a real
codebase, and the three fields that need actual thought.
