# Text file opened without an encoding

## Smell

```python
def read_config(path):
    with open(path) as handle:
        return json.load(handle)
```

## Why it's bad

- Without `encoding=`, Python uses the locale encoding (`locale.getencoding()`), which is UTF-8 on most Linux machines and
  historically cp1252 on Windows, so the same file parses differently on two developers' laptops.
- The failure is content-dependent: files of pure ASCII behave identically everywhere, so the bug appears only
  once a name contains an accent or a dash that is not the ASCII hyphen.
- When decoding does fail it raises `UnicodeDecodeError` pointing at a byte offset, which reads as a corrupt
  file rather than a wrong assumption about the reader.
- Worse than the crash is the silent case, where cp1252 decodes UTF-8 bytes into mojibake without error and the
  wrong string is stored.

## Better

```python
def read_config(path):
    with open(path, encoding="utf-8") as handle:
        return json.load(handle)
```
