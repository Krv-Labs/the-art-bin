# Hardcoded cuda device

## Smell

```python
def embed(model, batch):
    model = model.cuda()
    batch = batch.to("cuda")
    return model(batch)
```

## Why it's bad

- The function will not run on a machine without a GPU, so nobody can execute the test suite on a laptop and
  CI has to be given hardware it does not need.
- `"cuda"` means whichever device is current, which is device zero unless something called
  `torch.cuda.set_device`, so on a multi-GPU host every call lands on that one card regardless of where the
  caller's tensors live, and two parallel jobs that never set a device fight over it.
- The device is a property of the run, not of this function, so hardcoding it removes the one decision the
  caller actually needs to make while leaving the function no less complicated.
- It presents as a `RuntimeError` about tensors on different devices, raised somewhere downstream, once one
  more function in the chain is written slightly differently.

## Better

```python
def embed(model, batch, device):
    model = model.to(device)
    return model(batch.to(device))
```
