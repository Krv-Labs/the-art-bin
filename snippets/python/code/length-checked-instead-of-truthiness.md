# Length compared to zero instead of truthiness

## Smell

```python
def report(rows):
    if len(rows) > 0:
        print(summarise(rows))
    if len(rows) == 0:
        print("no rows")
```

## Why it's bad

- Every container in the language is already falsy when empty, so `if rows:` states the condition directly
  while `len(rows) > 0` states an arithmetic consequence of it.
- The comparison invites variants — `>= 1`, `!= 0`, `> 0` — that agree only because a length is never
  negative, and reviewers have to check each one instead of recognising a single idiom.
- The negative form is the tell: `if len(rows) == 0` is three tokens away from `if not rows`, and the second one
  is the sentence the author would say out loud.

## Better

```python
def report(rows):
    if rows:
        print(summarise(rows))
    else:
        print("no rows")
```
