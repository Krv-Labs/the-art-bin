# String concatenation in a loop

## Smell

```python
def render(rows):
    out = ""
    for row in rows:
        out += format_row(row) + "\n"
    return out
```

## Why it's bad

- Strings are immutable, so each iteration builds a new object and copies everything accumulated so far.
- CPython has an in-place optimisation that can hide the cost, but it is fragile even in CPython and absent
  from implementations without reference counting, so performance depends on details far from this loop.
- It states the mechanism rather than the intent, where `join` says "one string from many parts" directly.

## Better

```python
def render(rows):
    return "\n".join(format_row(row) for row in rows) + "\n"
```
